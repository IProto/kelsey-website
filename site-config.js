      "Sunset Ridge Retreat is a beautifully restored farmhouse perched on a quiet hilltop, offering sweeping views of the Willamette Valley. Originally built in the 1920s, the home has been lovingly renovated to blend rustic charm with modern comforts.",
      "Whether you're sipping coffee on the wraparound porch at sunrise or stargazing from the fire pit at night, every moment here feels like a deep breath of fresh air. The property sits on five private acres, giving you total seclusion while remaining just 15 minutes from downtown wine country."
